Lambdas and scope
    Lambdas don't have their own scope, but share the scope of the enclosing environment
    Thus, lambdas cannot define identifier names that already exists in the enclosing scope
    Fields and methods of the enclosing scope can be accessed from within the lambda
    Local variables of the enclosing scope can be accessed if they are final or effectively final
