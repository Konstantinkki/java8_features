Optional methods
    deal with null values elegantly
    extra functionality, such as validation

    Optional Methods :
        isPresent
        orElse
        orElseGet
        orElseThrow
        filter
        map

Get the value Out of the Optional
    we could get a NoSuchElementException with the get method
    Check with ifPresent before using get
    But ...thet's a lot like dealing with null
    more methods with different options!

filter : if the element doesn't match the Predicate, it returns an empty Optional
map: specifies an operation to be applied to the non-null value; if there is no value, it will return an empty Optional
