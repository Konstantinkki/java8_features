tOptional is meant for return type
    for example, querying  the data layer
    The result may or may not be null
    No constant null checks on the returned value
    no NPEs due to forgetting to check for null

    Optional :
    elegant solution for returning null
    Methods available to deal with the wrapped value
    we don't forget we could have been dealing with a null
    and that means 1fewer NPEs!

    Optional is for returning only.
    It should not be used as a parameter or field type.
