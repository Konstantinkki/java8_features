Lazy Streams
    not executed until a terminal operation is called on the Stream
    we need a terminal operation to complete the stream pipeline
    only one terminal operation can be called on a Stream

Common Terminal Operations:
    forEach
    min
    count
    max
    allMatch
    anyMatch
    collect
    noneMatch
