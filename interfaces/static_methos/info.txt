AN interface can contain static methods since Java 8
These methods are implemented with a method body (not abstract)
can only be called on the interface (InterfaceName.staticMethodName() )
Cannot be overriden or hidden in the class and belong to the interface

Why do we want static methods in interface :
    Allows for implementation in interfaces
    Avoids cluttering of codebase with utility classes with static code when there is an interface
    Overusing it is probably a code smell
