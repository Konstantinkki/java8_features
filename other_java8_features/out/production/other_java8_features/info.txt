Arrays
    Arrays can be sorted
    New concurrent strategy in Java7 : ForkJoinPool
    Arrays.parallelSort
    Not always faster

    Array parallel sorting works faster if count of if items very huge !

------------ Unsigned Integer
32 bit value
Normal range -2147483648 to 2147483647
we don't make integers unsigned with this feature
But we can do calculations with them as if they were unsigned

-----------Concurrent API improve
new Interfaces
new methods in the ForkJoinPool
ConcurrentHashMap additions
Atomic variables options
new Class StampedLock - lock for read write access

----------------java memory
Stack : holds local variables and references for the methods
Heap : holds all the objects
    PermGen -
        part of the heap
        holds loaded classes and their metadata
        difficult for the garbage collector
    PermGen replaced by the MetaSpace

    MetaSpace :
        Optimized allocation and deallocation to avoid OutOfMemory errors
        By default, it could grow indefinitely
